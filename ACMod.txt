ACMod - Azura's Coast Fixed
This mod aims to fix as many visual and placement errors as possible in Azura's Coast Region.
Due to terrain edits, compatibility with other landscape altering mods (islands, overhauls) won't be perfect. Any mods altering the landscape of an Azura's Coast Region cell should be loaded after ACMod, otherwise the game will load the terrain from this mod. You could also run the risk of objects edited by this mod appearing in awkward positions in the hypothetical conflicting mods. I tried to avoid touching terrain at the border of cells, but it wasn't always possible.
