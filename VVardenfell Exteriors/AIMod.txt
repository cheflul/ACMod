AIMod - Ascadian Isles patched
This mod aims to fix as many visual and placement errors as possible in the Ascadian Isles Region.
Due to terrain edits, any mods in the covered area should be loaded after AIMod, otherwise the modified vanilla terrain will be used. I tried to avoid touching cell borders for this reason.
Vivec cells will be untouched for compatibility, and because there's really not much going on needing fixing. Fixes in other settlements will be optional, with a modular or combined version of AIMod.
Any cell with "Terrain errors fixed" or "Texture seams fixed" will contain landscape edits.
